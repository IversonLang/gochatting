This application demonstrates how to use the Google Go language and HTML5 Websockets to implement a simple web chat application.

You can join the chat room by entering your email, which will be used as your name and generate an avatar from Gravatar. When you are in the chat, you can find buddies with avatars and names who are already in the room from the top right area. And then, of course, you are able to type and input messages to chat with others.
